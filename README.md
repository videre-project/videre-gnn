## Overview

(Currently still an early WIP)

> **⚠️ Important note:** As our exported models are very large (~500 MB to 1 GB in size), instead of providing the exported models as files in our GitHub repository, we've opted for adding them to [releases](https://github.com/videre-project/videre-gnn/releases) as `.tar.gz` files. This allows us to still maintain a public release history for them while providing the source code under the same umbrella repository.
